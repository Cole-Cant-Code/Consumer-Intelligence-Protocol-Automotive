# Commercial Licensing

Consumer-Intelligence-Protocol-Automotive (`AutoCIP`, historically `CIP-Auto`
or `CIP Auto`) is source-available under the Business Source License 1.1 in
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Some commercial uses are restricted by default, including operating a competing
commercial vehicle marketplace that monetizes dealer or manufacturer advertising,
placement, sponsorship, or lead-generation services.

## When You Need A Commercial License

### Safe Harbors (Free to Use in Production)

The following are examples of production use cases that are generally permitted
under the default license and do not require a separate commercial agreement:

1. Internal use by a single dealership group to assist its W2 employees.
2. Building a generic personal finance app that includes a single auto-loan
   or vehicle affordability calculator.
3. Academic, nonprofit, or journalistic research into automotive market trends.

These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. If your use case is close to a
competing commercial vehicle marketplace service, request written confirmation.

You likely need a commercial license if you plan to:

1. Offer AutoCIP-powered dealer placement or sponsored ranking to third parties.
2. Sell lead-generation or referral services to dealers/manufacturers using AutoCIP.
3. Embed AutoCIP as core marketplace infrastructure in a paid competing product.
