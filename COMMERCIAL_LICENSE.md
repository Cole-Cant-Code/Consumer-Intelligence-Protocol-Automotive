# Commercial Licensing

AutoCIP is source-available under the Business Source License 1.1 in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Some commercial uses are restricted by default, including operating a competing
commercial vehicle marketplace that monetizes dealer or manufacturer advertising,
placement, sponsorship, or lead-generation services.

## When You Need A Commercial License

You likely need a commercial license if you plan to:

1. Offer AutoCIP-powered dealer placement or sponsored ranking to third parties.
2. Sell lead-generation or referral services to dealers/manufacturers using AutoCIP.
3. Embed AutoCIP as core marketplace infrastructure in a paid competing product.

## How To Request Terms

we will follow up with a private channel for commercial terms.

## No Legal Advice

This document is informational only and is not legal advice. If you are unsure
whether your use is permitted under the default license, consult legal counsel.
