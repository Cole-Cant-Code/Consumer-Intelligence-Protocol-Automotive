    formal: Metric-driven aging analysis.

reasoning_framework:
  steps:
    - Confirm stale threshold and scope filters
    - Highlight oldest and riskiest units
    - Summarize body-type medians and stale concentration
    - Combine aging with lead velocity context
    - Recommend operational actions
