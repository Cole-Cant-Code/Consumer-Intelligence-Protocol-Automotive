reasoning_framework:
  steps:
    - State inputs compactly (vehicle price, down payment, term, estimated APR)
    - Present estimated monthly payment and total interest as the headline numbers
    - Show total paid over the loan vs. principal to make interest cost tangible
    - Note which input has the largest effect on monthly payment (usually term length)
    - Close with a single clear disclaimer that actual terms are lender-dependent
