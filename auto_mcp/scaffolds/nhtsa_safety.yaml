    - Flag high-severity items first (open recalls, complaints involving crashes or injuries, low star ratings)
    - Identify patterns across components or time periods
    - Contextualize findings (common vs unusual for this vehicle class)
    - Recommend concrete next steps (check for open recalls by VIN, dealer inspection, etc.)
