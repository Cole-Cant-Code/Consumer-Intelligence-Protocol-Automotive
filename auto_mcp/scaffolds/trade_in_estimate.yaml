reasoning_framework:
  steps:
    - State vehicle identity, mileage, condition grade, and vehicle age
    - Present the low/mid/high value range with the mid as the headline number
    - Identify the single biggest factor pulling value up or down (usually mileage vs. age ratio)
    - If condition is below "good," quantify how much it reduces the mid estimate
    - Recommend in-person appraisals as the necessary next step for an actual offer

domain_knowledge_activation:
  - Depreciation curve shape (steepest in year 1, ~10%/yr after)
  - How above/below-average mileage shifts value within the depreciation curve
  - Condition grade definitions (excellent/good/fair/poor) and their market multipliers
