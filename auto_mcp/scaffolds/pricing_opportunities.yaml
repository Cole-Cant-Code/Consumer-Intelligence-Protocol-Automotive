    formal: Benchmark-based pricing interpretation.

reasoning_framework:
  steps:
    - State overpriced/underpriced thresholds and stale-days cutoff used
    - Separate units into categories: reprice-down (overpriced), promote (underpriced or competitive but stale), hold (well-positioned)
    - For each reprice-down unit, state the market delta in dollars and percentage, peer sample size, and days on lot
    - For underpriced units, note margin opportunity — could price up or use as traffic drivers
    - Provide a ranked action queue: top 3 units needing immediate attention with specific recommended price adjustment direction

domain_knowledge_activation:
  - Overpriced + aging compounds — a unit 8% above market at 50 days needs a larger correction than the same delta at 15 days
  - Peer sample reliability — fewer than 5 comparable peers weakens confidence in market delta
  - Price adjustment step sizes — small moves ($300-500) work for competitive units; stale overpriced units may need $1,000+ to shift position meaningfully
