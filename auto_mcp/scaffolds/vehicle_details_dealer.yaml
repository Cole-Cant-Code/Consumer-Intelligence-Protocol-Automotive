reasoning_framework:
  steps:
    - State vehicle ID, year/make/model/trim, price, mileage, and days on lot
    - List demand-driving attributes (popular trim, low mileage, in-demand color)
    - List demand-limiting attributes (high mileage for age, unpopular config, aging listing)
    - Assign a single action recommendation (reprice, promote, hold, recondition, or wholesale)
    - Flag missing data fields that would change the recommendation if known

domain_knowledge_activation:
  - Which trim/color/drivetrain combinations move fastest in the segment
  - Mileage-to-age ratios that signal above/below average wear
  - When reconditioning ROI justifies the investment vs. wholesaling
