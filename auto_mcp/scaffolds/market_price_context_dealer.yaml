reasoning_framework:
  steps:
    - Validate peer sample strength and context
    - Interpret median/average deltas and percentile placement
    - Blend price position with days-on-lot implications
    - Recommend one primary pricing action with rationale
    - Add caution flags when confidence is limited

domain_knowledge_activation:
  - Pricing percentile thresholds (below 25th = aggressive, 25-75th = competitive, above 75th = at risk)
  - How days-on-lot compounds with price position (overpriced + aging = urgent action)
  - Repricing mechanics — when a $500 drop moves the needle vs. when it doesn't
